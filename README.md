# Website

This repository contains a simple "About Me" website personalized for Charlie Lichterman.

To view the site, open `index.html` in your web browser. Update
`index.html` and `styles.css` with your own information and style.

Note: No automated tests are configured, so `npm test` will fail until a test setup is added.
